# UE4-NN-Car
Genetic algorithms neural network based on UE4's blueprints

The simulation to test NN classes is based on UE4's Advanced Vehicle template. Genetic algorithm uses distance driven and average distance from the driving line for reward (fitness) function, and collision detection capsule and current distance from the driving line as inputs.
